# OTUS Data Engineering Take Home 
**Wikipedia Log scraping and analysis**

**Your assignment** 

Publish a repo on Github that i can clone and run on my local machine. Your repo should contain full code for a program that scrapes [https://dumps.wikimedia.org/](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/) across 7 days (pick your date range) and can answer the following questions
	
1. Most requested article by day
2. Least requested article by day
3. Top 5 categories by day

 Use Python or a JVM language to complete this.
 
1. If you use a JVM language, avoid the use of mega-frameworks like Spring Data.  
2. Automated tests need to be in place
3. Support for running on Kubernetes should be in place
	
**How we evaluate**
1. Functionality — Does your program work according to the specifications of the problem?
2. Modeling — Is the program's control flow clear?
3. Documentation — Is your code appropriately documented in the form appropriate to your implementation language?
4. Language Use — Do you make good use of the features available in the language you chose?
5. Testing — Did you include tests that explain and reinforce the design of your code?


## Written
**Ramping up**
Explain what an ideal 30/60/90 day plan looks like for you as you start a new role with Otus. This is important since we are small and you will need to self-direct most days.

## Timeframe for this assignment
 You set the date.  This gives you plenty of time to do this.
