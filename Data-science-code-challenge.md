# OTUS Data Science Take Home
**Machine Learning with Student Performance**

**Your assignment** 

[UCI Machine Learning Repository:  Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance)

Define 5 questions that you can answer with this dataset, then ship us a git repo where we can run your analysis as a jupyter notebook.  

We want to understand what insights can be reasonably drawn from the existing data and how can you support those claims?

---
As you work on your solution, please be prepared to answer the following questions
1. What statistical models did you chose for your analysis and why?
2. What, if any, libraries did you select to help you analyze the data and why?
3. Does this data need cleaned up or enriched? if so, how?
4. If you were to maintain your model on an on-going basis, what kind of data engineering support would it require broadly speaking?
5. What would be needed to get this model to production-ready status?

	
**How we evaluate**
1. Functionality — Does your program work according to the specifications of the problem?
2. Modeling — Is the program's control flow clear?
3. Documentation — Is your code appropriately documented in the form appropriate to your implementation language?
4. Language Use — Do you make good use of the features available in the language you chose?
5. Testing — Did you include tests that explain and reinforce the design of your code?


## Written
**Ramping up**
Explain what an ideal 30/60/90 day plan looks like for you as you start a new role with Otus. This is important since we are small and you will need to self-direct most days.

## Timeframe for this assignment
 You set the date.  This gives you plenty of time to do this.
