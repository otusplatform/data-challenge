# OTUS Data Science Intern Challenge

**Machine Learning with Student Performance**

**Your assignment** 

[UCI Machine Learning Repository:  Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance)

Define 5 questions that you can answer with this dataset, then ship us a git repo where we can run your analysis as a jupyter notebook.  

We want to understand what insights can be reasonably drawn from the existing data and how can you support those claims?

---
As you work on your solution, please be prepared to answer the following questions
1. What statistical models did you chose for your analysis and why?
2. What, if any, libraries did you select to help you analyze the data and why?
3. Does this data need cleaned up or enriched? if so, how?
4. If you were to maintain your model on an on-going basis, what kind of data engineering support would it require broadly speaking?
5. What would be needed to get this model to production-ready status?
